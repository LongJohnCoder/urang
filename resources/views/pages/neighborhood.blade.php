            <p>With the recent growth spurt in the area, we know that local dry cleaners are popping up but do you really trust your garment care to someone who just opened up, or a drop store that does their cleaning off site. TriBeCa is a neighborhood that now has a strong emphasis on family and school and we are proud to be able to assist the residents and new families. We know how valuable your time is and how hard it is to raise children with time being our most valuable asset, we are offering families with newborn children a special rate on wash & fold service for the family. We will come and pickup twice a week (or more if you need it) and handle all your laundry service. We only use safe detergents for children, (Dreft), we clean, sort and fold all the clothes, so you newborn moms have a little time to yourself. We do our dry cleaning and laundry on site in Gramercy. We do not wholesale the cleaning and we treat every garment with the outmost care, while still keeping our prices intact.</p>
